        <u>  <i> <b> A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer. </i> </b> </u> The performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) instead of million instructions per second (MIPS). Since 2017, there have existed supercomputers which can perform over 1017 FLOPS (a hundred quadrillion FLOPS, 100 petaFLOPS or 100 PFLOPS).
